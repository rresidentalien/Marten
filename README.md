Firefox extension that converts Euro (€) to Croatian Kuna (HRK) inline if possible. If not, you can use the extension popup to convert manually. Conversion rate: 1€ = 7.53450 Kn (fixed).

Currently does not work properly if a website uses . to separate prices larger than a thousand (e.g. 1.199,99 €), or if euros and cents are separate list items/containers. In those cases you can use the extension popup.
